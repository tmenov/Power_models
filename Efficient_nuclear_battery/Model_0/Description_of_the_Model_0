The model is a source of constant alpha and weak neutron radiation surrounded by cylinders made of metal alloys.
The whole structure is housed in a stainless steel bottle with a screw cap. 
The bottle contains He gas with a purity of at least 99% with an overpressure of 3 atm.

Container bottle description.
The bottle and cap are made of 5mm stainless steel. 
Between the cap at the end of the bottle in a recess (not shown) is a silicone sealing ring.
A capillary tube for gas injection is glued into the covers.
After assembly and final installation of all elements, 
the threads on both the bottle and the lid side are thickly lubricated with epoxy glue containing carbon powder. 
After assembly, excess squeezed out glue is removed.
Gas pumping is carried out only after the glue has completely cured. 
After pumping, the stainless steel capillary tube is clamped and sealed by precision arc welding.
